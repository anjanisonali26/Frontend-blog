              This lake is one of the masterpieces of natural beauty that is
              bestowed by the Almighty on the land of East Java. Before heading
              to the peak of Semeru, it is at this lake location that climbers
              will usually prepare tents to rest or spend the night. While
              gathering energy, they can enjoy the beauty of the lake or explore
              the beautiful natural scenery around with a camera. For those of
              you who have never been to Ranu Kumbolo and are interested in
              setting foot there, before leaving, please refer to some important
              information regarding Kumbolo Lake in the following article. This
              lake is located in the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park
              (TNBTS).<span id="dots">....</span>
            </p>
            <p id="readmore">
              Located at an altitude of appoximately 2,400 meters above sea
              level, the air temperature in this area is very cool and
              comfortable to relax. If you have time to come to the location of
              this lake during the holiday season, you will find many climbers
              or tourists who deliberately come just to camp and spend their
              holiday time in this place. Ranu Kumbolo does offer a beauty that
              is second to none. In addition to the exotic form of the lake that
              spoils the eye, in the afternoon we can also watch the sunset
              moment that appears between the peaks of two mountains from the
              lake location. In addition, for visitors who like photography,
              this place is a paradise to channel that hobby.

            Not how often you face conflicts when you are with him, but how mature you are to find solutions together. Friends become a place to share fatigue, share sadness and never sell our secrets. Weak people are people who are unable to make friends but weaker people are people who waste the friends they already have
